# WIP - Purrugly
The fast PureScript formatter -- or as Bulbapedia puts it:
> It is a brazen brute that barges its way into another Pok√©mon's nest and claims it as its own.

This project is very much a work in progress, and aims to be faster and more aggressive than [purescript-tidy](https://github.com/natefaubion/purescript-tidy). purs-tidy never changes the AST but Purrugly happily rewrites entire functions for you if it dislikes their face.
